# Simon Game Replica

This front end application emulates the functionalities of the SIMON game. Features include a counter, which counts the number of correct sequences made by the player, and a strict mode, where an incorrect sequence will reset the game.
Non-gameplay features include an option to change the background.
Credit is owed to the companies Milton Bradley and Hasbro, and the inventors Howard J. Morrison and Ralph H. Baer for all the design and interface elements.
